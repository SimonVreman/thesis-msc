Task:
Identify wasteful cloud virtual machine instances based on CPU usage.

Input:
A list of instances. Each instance includes:

    id

    avgCpu (average CPU usage)

Instructions:

    For each instance, determine whether it is wastefulâ€”defined as having low average CPU usage, such as less than 10%.

    Base your assessment on the provided avgCpu value.

Output:
Return the results in a clear, structured format, with one entry per instance indicating whether it is considered wasteful.
